        I developed this application as a starter pack for building applications
        using React on both the frontend and backend. It serves as documentation
        to accelerate the development framework, allowing developers to create
        applications more efficiently without having to start from scratch. This
        project is open to all developers and is free to be cloned, modified,
        and further improved.
